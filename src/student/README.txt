2. I have none.
3. For both the contains and getSequence methods in the CodeBook,
   the expected runtime is log n due to the Binary Search Tree Data Structure
   (where n = the number of characters in the codebook).
4. The runtime of the HuffmanCodeTree.decode method is O(b),
   where b = the number of bits in the binarySequence.
   This method runs in linear time as it simply looks through all the inputted bits.
